# Netflix  
>The data that was collected and manipulated can be found in this csv file, "NFLX_raw_data.csv"

![Netflix Logo](https://github.com/rogersnd/Netflix/blob/main/Images/netflix_logo.png)  

The file has **253** data entries and **8** columns of information, including dates and prices and information for the stock on a given day.  

We save this dataframe as **data1**.  

An additional is eventually appended to data1, **Rate of Return**, which is calculated through our analyses.
