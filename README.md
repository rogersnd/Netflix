This repository was made to collect live data from the internet of my choosing, manipulate the data into more interesting and useful findings, visualize those findings, and then publish said findings through using Shiny, an interactive web application.  

All code used to gather, calculate, visualize, and publish can be found in the **Code** folder.  

All plots generated have been saved and can be found in the **Images** folder.  

The data that was calculated on the given day, Aug. 18, 2022, can be found in a saved csv file **"NFLX_raw_data.csv"**, located in the **Raw Data** folder.
